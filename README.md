# dotfiles
## Lauri's Unix preferences

I wrote and collected these settings that make me enjoy Linux more.
Notice the original links in many of the config files.

## Setup

1. `git clone git@github.com:mollikka/dotfiles.git`
2. `cd dotfiles`
3. `bash <distro>/<distro>_installstuff.sh`
4. `bash setup.sh`
