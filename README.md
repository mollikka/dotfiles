# dotfiles
## Lauri's Unix preferences

I wrote and collected these settings that make me enjoy Unix more.
Notice the original links in many of the config files.

## Setup

1. Install `git`, `vim`, `zsh`
2. `cd`
3. `git clone git@github.com:mollikka/dotfiles.git`
4. `cd ~/dotfiles`
5. `bash setup.sh`

## How did I set this thing up..

###Change audio volume

- `amixer set Master 50%`
- `amixer set Master mute`
- `amixer set Master unmute`
